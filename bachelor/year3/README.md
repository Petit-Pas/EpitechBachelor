## Year 3

The 3rd year was mostly based on web and mobile application, which I am not interested in. I the n selected the only challenging and interesting project of that year.

* gomoku: An IA that was supposed to win a game of Gomoku with a few important rules, an IA that takes more than 5 seconds to play is disqualified, and an IA that takes more than 70 MB of memory is disqualified.
My IA was part of the tournament winners, as I won lots of time and ressource (hence performance) by doing pattern recognition in addition to the classical A/B trees. 1st time I learned how to play a game by watching an IA I made.
