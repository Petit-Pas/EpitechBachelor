## cpp

Projects made in C++, mostly made to learn about OOP and software architecture.

* arcade: An arcade engine, able to switch between different graphical libraries (both sprite or term based) and different game libraries, all of them being dynamically loaded at launch. Even the interface allowing this architecture are made by me.
* plazza: A project supposed to teach us how to use Threads and fork() together with dynamic threadpools. The idea is to scrap many files at the same time looking for sensitive data.
* indie_studio: A network based 3D bomberman game.
