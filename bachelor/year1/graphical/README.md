## graphical

The projects here are all made with the CSFML library (C wrapper for SFML). I was only allowed to use the framebuffer technology for those projects, no sprite, only pixels colors and coordinates.

* wireframe: learning the isometric projection to display a 3D surface
* wolf3D: learning about the raycasting techonology in order to be able to move in a maze like in the wolfenstein 3D game
* raytracer1: A raytracing engine, able to do multiple 3D objects, colors, intersection, shadows and luminosity.
* raytracer2: Evolution of the raytracer1. Adds texturing, anti aliasing, multi-threading, reflexion and transparence for real looking images.
